    <p>Hello, my name is Jean Esteves, I'm from <strong>Brazil, Volta Redonda/RJ.</strong><br>I'm an environmental technician, graduated from the Federal Institute of Rio de Janeiro in Pinheiral, currently studying at Trybe, where I am focused on being a new Web Developer and building a career based on this profession that I think amazing. As an environmental technician, I did an internship in topography and irrigation, with that I managed to evolve a lot mentally and physically too, it helped a lot in my evolution as a person. Currently I discovered what I really want to learn and focus on my career - Web Development - and Trybe fit like a glove.<br>I'm still at the beginning of my journey and I hope to evolve a lot!</p>
